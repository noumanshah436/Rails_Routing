member routes: routes that needs the id to perform action (like  show, edit, update destroy)

collection routes : routes that do not need id ti perform action ( lik index, create , new)

***************************

namespace routing is used when you want to organize group of controllers under a namespace

***************************

create controler in subdirectory:

rails g controller admin/Users

http://localhost:3000/admin/sellers

rails g scaffold admin/Sellers name:string
rails db:migrate

rails g scaffold animals/Cat name:string age:integer
rails db:migrate

**********************************

or you can add existing controller in sub folder and then add Admin:: before controller class
and move routes under namespace
and at last we need to set the new links to our buttons

**********************************


# this will remove the admin prefix from the url and is still use controller in admin folder
scope  module: :admin do
  resources :students
end

Note: change links in case you change scope or namespace accordingly

**********************************

if you want admin prefix to your routes and not want the namespace
( i.e you want normal controller in Controller folder not in any sub folder)

scope :admin do
  resources :students
end
