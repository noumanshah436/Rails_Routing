member routes: routes that needs the id to perform action (like  show, edit, update destroy)

collection routes : routes that do not need id ti perform action ( lik index, create , new)

***************************

namespace routing is used when you want to organize group of controllers under a namespace

***************************

create controler in subdirectory:

rails g controller admin/Users

rails g scaffold admin/Sellers name:string
rails g model Seller name:string               -- we need to create model separately

http://localhost:3000/admin/sellers


**********************************

or you can add existing controller in sub folder and then add Admin:: before controller class
and move routes under namespace
and at last we need to set the new links to our buttons
